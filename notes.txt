2/18/25 -- did a bunch of work over long weekend
- ui and charts have made great progress

- a bunch of props need to be configured like 'bpm', 'Watts' etc.
- now data is passed between UI and workout needs to be rethought
- enable and disable of buttons needs a rethink
- a lot of settings and options can be moved to a config page
    - power/rpm enable
- add mongo process to merge values that happen at the same second
- add average values for all LRUs
- add background view with expected workout values to charts

2/17/25 -- some notes on next tasks
- disable buttons when not available
- show connection to hrm and power
