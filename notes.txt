Status and Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/10/25  - notes after not working on project for a few weeks
* got new dev laptop and so moving work to it
* will move code into docker container to keep separate
* as far as I remember it was kind of working but threading issues. 
    - I had created a simple sub test to work on running each bluetooth process in separate python process
    - it needs to communicate via zmq and that wasn't 100%
* next steps
    - create docker container and move code in
    - get zmq communication working
    - integrate zmq code into actual app
